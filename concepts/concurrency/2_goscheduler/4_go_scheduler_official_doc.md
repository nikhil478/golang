// Goroutine scheduler
// The scheduler's job is to distribute ready-to-run goroutines over worker threads.
//
// The main concepts are:
// G - goroutine.
// M - worker thread, or machine.
// P - processor, a resource that is required to execute Go code.
//     M must have an associated P to execute Go code, however it can be
//     blocked or in a syscall w/o an associated P.

// Worker thread parking/unparking.
// We need to balance between keeping enough running worker threads to utilize
// available hardware parallelism and parking excessive running worker threads
// to conserve CPU resources and power. This is not simple for two reasons:
// (1) scheduler state is intentionally distributed (in particular, per-P work
// queues), so it is not possible to compute global predicates on fast paths;
// (2) for optimal thread management we would need to know the future (don't park
// a worker thread when a new goroutine will be readied in near future).
//
// Three rejected approaches that would work badly:
// 1. Centralize all scheduler state (would inhibit scalability).
// 2. Direct goroutine handoff. That is, when we ready a new goroutine and there
//    is a spare P, unpark a thread and handoff it the thread and the goroutine.
//    This would lead to thread state thrashing, as the thread that readied the
//    goroutine can be out of work the very next moment, we will need to park it.
//    Also, it would destroy locality of computation as we want to preserve
//    dependent goroutines on the same thread; and introduce additional latency.
// 3. Unpark an additional thread whenever we ready a goroutine and there is an
//    idle P, but don't do handoff. This would lead to excessive thread parking/
//    unparking as the additional threads will instantly park without discovering
//    any work to do.
//
// The current approach:
//
// This approach applies to three primary sources of potential work: readying a
// goroutine, new/modified-earlier timers, and idle-priority GC. See below for
// additional details.
//
// We unpark an additional thread when we submit work if (this is wakep()):
// 1. There is an idle P, and
// 2. There are no "spinning" worker threads.
//
// A worker thread is considered spinning if it is out of local work and did
// not find work in the global run queue or netpoller; the spinning state is
// denoted in m.spinning and in sched.nmspinning. Threads unparked this way are
// also considered spinning; we don't do goroutine handoff so such threads are
// out of work initially. Spinning threads spin on looking for work in per-P
// run queues and timer heaps or from the GC before parking. If a spinning
// thread finds work it takes itself out of the spinning state and proceeds to
// execution. If it does not find work it takes itself out of the spinning
// state and then parks.
//
// If there is at least one spinning thread (sched.nmspinning>1), we don't
// unpark new threads when submitting work. To compensate for that, if the last
// spinning thread finds work and stops spinning, it must unpark a new spinning
// thread. This approach smooths out unjustified spikes of thread unparking,
// but at the same time guarantees eventual maximal CPU parallelism
// utilization.
//
// The main implementation complication is that we need to be very careful
// during spinning->non-spinning thread transition. This transition can race
// with submission of new work, and either one part or another needs to unpark
// another worker thread. If they both fail to do that, we can end up with
// semi-persistent CPU underutilization.
//
// The general pattern for submission is:
// 1. Submit work to the local or global run queue, timer heap, or GC state.
// 2. #StoreLoad-style memory barrier.
// 3. Check sched.nmspinning.
//
// The general pattern for spinning->non-spinning transition is:
// 1. Decrement nmspinning.
// 2. #StoreLoad-style memory barrier.
// 3. Check all per-P work queues and GC for new work.
//
// Note that all this complexity does not apply to global run queue as we are
// not sloppy about thread unparking when submitting to global queue. Also see
// comments for nmspinning manipulation.
//
// How these different sources of work behave varies, though it doesn't affect
// the synchronization approach:
// * Ready goroutine: this is an obvious source of work; the goroutine is
//   immediately ready and must run on some thread eventually.
// * New/modified-earlier timer: The current timer implementation (see time.go)
//   uses netpoll in a thread with no work available to wait for the soonest
//   timer. If there is no thread waiting, we want a new spinning thread to go
//   wait.
// * Idle-priority GC: The GC wakes a stopped idle thread to contribute to
//   background GC work (note: currently disabled per golang.org/issue/19112).
//   Also see golang.org/issue/44313, as this should be extended to all GC
//   workers.
